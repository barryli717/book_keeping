# book_keeping
 
For book keeping and related operations. To make these programs runnable on mobile phones, these programms are written in `.ipynb` files, thus we can run the codes on Azure Notebook.

## Operations

1. Run `new_item` to add new item(s) into the dataset;

2. Run `summary` to get the monthly aggregated spend;

3. Run `delete` to delete several entries;

4. Run `initialize` to initialize the dataset (**attention!!**);
